            <p>To register for house allocation, you MUST:</p>
            <p>
              Allocation of houses to qualified applicants would start as soon
              as the construction of the affordable houses begins. The
              (allocation) process for the available houses would be done in a
              regular, fair and transparent system free of any human
              intervention and contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              The initial eligibility for allocation will depend on several
              factors such as when you registered, family status as well as
              demand across the housing categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those who do not get an allocation in the initial allocation are
              then put on a waiting list to ensure that they get priority in
              subsequent allocations.
